'''
Purpose: Acquire the source datasets needed for calculating phenologs and gene candidate predictions.

Datasets needed:
-Monarch KG
-Either Mondo->HPO disease to phenotype annotation from Monarch API (or KGX files) or HPOA
-

Rat Genome Database
- mouse Genome Database
- Zebrafish Information Network

Rat
mouse
Zebrafish
Worm
Chicken
Fission yeast?

These data sources can be expanded and the process rerun as additional model organism gene-phenotype annotations + panther orthologs are made available.
